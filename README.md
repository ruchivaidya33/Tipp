## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ X] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ X] Slider added to identify number of people to split bill among
- [X ] Added a button in the settings page to allow users to reset back to default tip percentages

## Notes

I am very new to iOS app development, and app development in general. Using Swift and XCode was a wonderful experience. The more I tried (and failed many times) to implement different feature, the more I wanted to dig in. I implemented a few of the optional features listed, and focused more on adding additional functionality I thought a user might want to have in tip calculating app. I plan on adding a few more features to my app soon.
